# PHP_TASK
PHP - Create and Submit a contact form

Create a:

Contact Form 
That submits to a file. 
This means, when a user submits that contact form, a file should be created for them, and the content of their contact should be in that file. The file should be named after the user, and should be unique to the user. More PHP resources will be provided on youtube to help you carry out this task better.

Push the code to GitHub, and submit the link to the code.
